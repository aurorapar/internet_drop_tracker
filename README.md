Naievely monitors network traffic to spot issues

I wanted to be able to have some metrics to figure out what was going on with my network. I have been having some issues with outages (whether or not they were planned I
do not know). I do not live in an area with many ISPs to choose from so I thought I'd create some metrics to look at.
